# page-loading
This component is usually used when the page data needs to be loaded asynchronously. In order to avoid the embarrassing situation of empty data on the page before the data loading is completed, the loading layer is displayed as the page loading transition. When using the page you want to use, it will not affect the original layout of your page.
